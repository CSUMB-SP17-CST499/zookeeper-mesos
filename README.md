# ZooKeeper framework for Mesos

This is a project that will allow for ZooKeeper to be run within a Mesos cluster (as a service).
This does not and cannot take the place of the ZooKeeper instance used to bootstrap Mesos to get it up
and running. With the help of New Relic our team of students at CSUMB created this as our capstone
project, and are releasing it Open Source so that everyone can benefit from it. 

# Documentation 

Documentation and prototypes are available in the /docs directory.
Current prototypes include an in-progress example of the scheduler written in Python.
